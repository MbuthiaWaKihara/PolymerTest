# Polymer Test

This repository is a test for proficiency in Polymer 3.0 
[polymer project](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/install-3-0), LitElements
[lit-element docs](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/start#download-the-starter-project) and
Bulma CSS [bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/general/). I did this test as a step for an internship position
application at InterIntel Technologies


## Highlights and Achievements

I began by learning what Polymer was all about, and familiarizing myself with LitElements as well as 
Bulma CSS. I gained enough knowledge to attempt the test within the stipulated time. I did the following 
on the different sections of the test

* **Section A** Required me to convert a polymer 3.0 custom element to a lit element. I then needed to introduce
a form in my element and capture user data, displaying it in both an alert box and the console. I was able to achieve all the tasks in this section, and even explore a bit of Bulma through Bulma cdn.
* **Section B** Required me to convert another polymer 3.0 custom element to a lit element, and then get creative from there. I did my best exploring some css skills and typing animations.
* **Section C** Required me to convert yet another polymer 3.0 custom element to a lit element, and then use it to fetch data from JSONPlaceholder using fetch API. I was able to fetch the data and display it on a polymer interface.
* **Section D** Required me to sort a dictionary both by key and value. Although I wrote a utility function to perform that task, I realized that placing the dictionary under an element property sorted it ascending automatically, making my utility function a no-op. I however left the utility function on the codebase
